# ya_inputdisplay
Yet another input display for Clone Hero / YARG **(WIP)**

It's made using Godot 4.2.1.

## Controls
- Click on top of the button to re-bind it to another key or button (**warning:** not saved yet);
- Press `-` to reset counters;

## TODO
This is still very early and WIP. Here are some of the main TODO items (in no particular order):
- Make Ardwiino PS3 be detected;
- Test with other guitars / Ardwiino settings;
- Make joypad support reading axes instead of only buttons;
- Implement calibration for axes;
- Save current bindings / settings;
- Color profile support (as hex values in the settings file).

My time to work on this is relatively limited, but feel free to open issues and pull requests. Contributions are very welcome!
